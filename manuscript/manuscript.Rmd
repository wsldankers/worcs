# We recommend that you prepare your raw data for analysis in 'prepare_data.R',
# and end that file with either open_data(yourdata), or closed_data(yourdata).
# Then, uncomment the line below to load the original or synthetic data
# (whichever is available), to allow anyone to reproduce your code:
# load_data()
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

This manuscript uses the Workflow for Open Reproducible Code in Science [@vanlissaWORCSWorkflowOpen2021] to ensure reproducibility and transparency. All code <!--and data--> are available at <git@[...].git>.

This is an example of a non-essential citation [@@vanlissaWORCSWorkflowOpen2021]. If you change the rendering function to `worcs::cite_essential`, it will be removed.

<!--The function below inserts a notification if the manuscript is knit using synthetic data. Make sure to insert it after load_data().-->
`r notify_synthetic()`

## GitHub Documents

This is an R Markdown format used for publishing markdown documents to GitHub. When you click the **Knit** button all R code chunks are run and a markdown file (.md) suitable for publishing to GitHub is generated.

## Including Code

You can include R code in the document as follows:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
